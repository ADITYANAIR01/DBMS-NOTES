                Primary Key

A Primary Key is the candidate key that is chosen to uniquely identify a row in a relation. The mandatory and desired attributes for a primary key are:

EmployeeNo(Key)
Good candidate as it is numeric, cannot be null and does not change with time.

AadharNo (Key)
It will be null for people who do not have Aadhar number. Hence it cannot be considered as primary key.

Name, DateOfBirth (Key)
Both Name and DateOfBirth cannot be null. However even if uniqueness is guranteed, it is not a good
choice due to lar e size.
