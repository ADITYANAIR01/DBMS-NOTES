  Which form based om partial dependency

  * First Normal Form (1NF): This basic form ensures atomic values in fields and a primary key. It doesn't address partial dependencies.

  * Second Normal Form (2NF): This builds on 1NF and requires every non-key attribute to be fully dependent on the entire primary key, eliminating partial dependencies.

  * Third Normal Form (3NF): This builds on 2NF and removes transitive dependencies between non-key attributes, further reducing redundancy.

  * Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): This is a stricter version of 3NF and eliminates all non-trivial dependencies involving non-key attributes.

  * Fourth Normal Form (4NF): This further eliminates multi-valued dependencies but is rarely used in practice due to its complexity.

  A Scheme describe 

  * A schema describes the overall structure and organization of a database table, encompassing all of the following elements:

  * Table name: The unique identifier for the table.

  * Columns (attributes): The individual fields that store specific data elements within each row.

  * Data types: The type of data that each column can hold (e.g., text, numbers, dates).

  * Constraints: Rules that enforce data integrity and consistency, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

  * Relationships: How the table is linked to other tables in the database.

  Which if the following  is relational algebra operation
  * All of these. 
  1. Select (σ):

    Filters tuples (rows) from a relation based on a specified condition.
    Creates a new relation containing only the tuples that meet the condition.
    Example: σ age > 25 (Employees) selects employees with ages greater than 

  2. Union (∪):

    Combines tuples from two compatible relations into a single relation.
    Eliminates duplicate tuples, resulting in a set of unique tuples.
    Example: R ∪ S combines tuples from relations R and S, removing duplicates.

  3. Rename (ρ):

    Assigns a new name to a relation or its attributes.
    Useful for making queries more readable or avoiding naming conflicts.
    Example: ρ E(Employees) renames the Employees relation to E.

            SECTION B (SHORT ANSWERS)

            Q1. Explain Entity ,relationship, derived attributes & Weak entity
  
  
Entity:

An entity is a real-world object or concept about which data is stored in a database. It can be tangible (e.g., a customer, product) or intangible 
(e.g., an order, event). An entity is represented as a rectangle in an Entity-Relationship diagram (ERD).

Examples:Customer: ID, name, address, email


Relationship:

A relationship represents the association between two or more entities. It describes how they are connected and what type of interaction exists between them. 
Relationships are shown as diamonds or lines connecting entities in an ERD.

Types of relationships:

* One-to-one: One entity instance associates with only one instance of another (e.g., a person has one passport).

* One-to-many: One entity instance associates with multiple instances of another (e.g., a customer can have many orders).

* Many-to-many: Multiple instances of one entity associate with multiple instances of another (e.g., actors can be in many movies, and movies can have many actors).


Derived Attributes:

A derived attribute is an attribute whose value can be calculated or derived from other attributes in the same entity. It improves data efficiency and avoids redundancy. 
Derived attributes are often represented with dashed lines in an ERD.


Weak Entity:

A weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and relies on its relationship with another, "strong" entity, for its existence. It typically has 
a partial key and shares the primary key of the strong entity. Weak entities are shown as double rectangles in an ERD.

Example:

A "phone number" entity might be weak, dependent on a "customer" entity, and share the customer ID as its primary key.


                Q2. What is advantages & disadvantages of DMBS

Advantages of DBMS:
1. Data Consistency and Integrity:

DBMS enforces data rules and constraints, ensuring all data stays consistent and accurate across the system.This minimizes errors, data duplication, and contradictions.

2. Shared Data and Security:

Multiple users can access and manage the same data simultaneously, optimizing collaboration and resource utilization. Built-in security features control user access and protect sensitive information.

3. Data Standardization and Efficiency:

DBMS offers a centralized data structure, standardizing data formats and eliminating redundancy.
This enhances efficiency by simplifying data retrieval and analysis.

4. Improved Data Analysis and Reporting:

DBMS facilitates complex data queries and aggregations, enabling insightful reports and data-driven decision making.
Built-in tools and query languages simplify data analysis for various users.

5. Data Backup and Recovery:

DBMS provides robust backup and recovery mechanisms, protecting against data loss due to hardware failures or human errors.
This ensures business continuity and minimizes downtime.

Disadvantages of DBMS:

1. Cost and Complexity:

Implementing and maintaining a DBMS can be expensive, requiring specialized hardware, software, and IT personnel.
Complex systems demand skilled administrators and training for users.

2. Dependence on Centralized System:

Single points of failure can occur, potentially disrupting data access and operations if the central system fails.
Requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and system vulnerabilities.

3. Performance Bottlenecks:

Managing and querying large datasets in a DBMS can become resource-intensive, leading to performance slowdowns if not optimized effectively.

4. Overkill for Simple Needs:

For small data sets or low-complexity applications, the features and overhead of a DBMS might not be necessary.
Simpler data storage solutions offer a lighter footprint and lower cost for such cases.

5. Vendor Lock-in:

Choosing a specific DBMS can create vendor lock-in, making it difficult and expensive to switch to another system in the future.
Carefully evaluate options and prioritize system openness and data portability.

                Q3. Explain various data types used in DBMS

* Numeric Data Types:

Integer: Stores whole numbers (e.g., -253, 0, 42). Variants include TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, BIGINT for different ranges.
Decimal/Numeric: Stores fixed-precision decimal numbers (e.g., 12.34, 98765.4321).
Float/Real: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (approximate values) for scientific calculations.

2. Character Data Types:

Character (CHAR): Fixed-length string of characters (e.g., 'hello').

Varchar (VARCHAR): Variable-length string of characters, more flexible than CHAR.

Text: Stores longer text passages (e.g., articles, descriptions).

3. Date and Time Data Types:

Date: Stores date values in various formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

Time: Stores time values in various formats (e.g., HH:MM:SS).

Datetime: Stores combined date and time values (e.g., 2024-01-04 21:18:00).

4. Boolean Data Type:

Boolean: Stores logical values, either TRUE or FALSE.

5. Binary Data Types:

Binary/Varbinary: Stores binary data (e.g., images, audio, files).

6. Other Specialized Data Types:

BLOB (Binary Large Object): Stores large binary objects like images or videos.

CLOB (Character Large Object): Stores large text data like documents or articles.

ENUM (Enumerated): Stores a set of predefined values (e.g., days of the week).

            Q4. What do you understand by table level constrains

Table-level constraints are rules that enforce data integrity and consistency at the level of an entire table in a database. 
They ensure that data entered into the table adheres to specific conditions and relationships, preventing errors, inconsistencies,
 and potential problems in data retrieval and analysis.

Here are the common types of table-level constraints:

* NOT NULL:

Prevents NULL values (empty or missing values) from being entered into a column.
Ensures that every row has a value for that attribute.
Example: CREATE TABLE Customers (ID INT NOT NULL, Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);

* UNIQUE:

Ensures that all values in a column are distinct, preventing duplicates.
Example: CREATE TABLE Students (RollNo INT UNIQUE, Name VARCHAR(255));

* PRIMARY KEY:

A unique identifier for each row in a table.
Must be unique and cannot contain NULL values.
Often used to link tables together in relationships.
Example: CREATE TABLE Orders (OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY, CustomerID INT, OrderDate DATE);

* FOREIGN KEY:

Establishes a link between two tables, enforcing referential integrity.
References a primary key in another table to ensure that values in the foreign key column correspond to existing values in the referenced table.
Example: CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (OrderID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Orders(OrderID), ProductID INT, Quantity INT);

* CHECK:

Validates data against a specified condition or range of values.
Ensures data meets certain criteria.
Example: CREATE TABLE Products (ProductID INT, Price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Price >= 0));

* DEFAULT:

Assigns a default value to a column if a value is not explicitly provided during insertion.
Ensures that columns always have a value, even if not specified.


            Q5. Explain significance of view. write syntax of creating view 


Significance of Views:
Views are virtual tables in a database derived from one or more underlying tables. 
They act as a window into existing data, offering several key benefits:

Simplified data access: Views can present a simplified view of complex data, hiding unnecessary columns or conditions from users. 

This makes it easier for users to understand and query the data without needing to understand the intricate underlying table structure.

Data security: Views can act as a security layer, restricting access to certain columns or rows in the underlying tables. 

This prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.

Data consistency: Views can enforce data integrity by inheriting constraints from the underlying tables. This 
ensures that data displayed through the view always adheres to the established rules.

Abstraction: Views can hide the complexity of joins and complex queries, presenting a unified and easy-to-use interface for accessing specific data combinations.

Performance optimization: By pre-calculated data, views can sometimes improve query performance, especially for frequently used queries.

\\ SYNTAX
CREATE VIEW <view_name> AS
SELECT <column_list>
FROM <table_name_1>
[JOIN <table_name_2> ON <join_condition>]
[WHERE <filter_condition>]
[ORDER BY <column_list>];

\\ 

                Q6.Explain various level of database architecture

Database architecture is the three-level schema architecture, often referred to as the ANSI-SPARC model. 
It defines three distinct levels of abstraction for describing a database:

1. External Level (View Level):

* Represents the user's view of the data.
* Provides multiple views of the same data tailored to different user needs and access levels.
* Hides internal details of the data storage and organization.
* Users interact with the database through queries based on these external views.

2. Conceptual Level (Logical Level):

* Provides an overall logical structure of the entire database.
* Describes the entities, attributes, and relationships between them, independent of physical storage details.
* Defines integrity constraints like primary and foreign keys to ensure data consistency.
* Serves as a blueprint for database developers and data analysts.

3. Internal Level (Physical Level):

* Deals with the physical storage and organization of data on the storage media.
* Defines how data is stored in files, indexes, and other physical structures.
* Optimizes for efficient data access and performance.
* Transparent to most users, managed by the database engine

                Q7. Describe ACID properties of transaction management.

 ACID properties represent a set of four crucial characteristics that ensure data consistency and integrity during transactions. 
 Transactions are units of work involving one or more data modifications, and ACID properties guarantee that these modifications are performed reliably and completely.

Here's a breakdown of each property:

1. Atomicity:

This property ensures that a transaction is an "all-or-nothing" operation. Either all the changes within the transaction are completed successfully,
or none of them are applied. This prevents partial updates or inconsistencies in the database.
Imagine transferring money between two accounts. Atomicity ensures either both accounts are updated, or the transfer fails entirely, 
leaving both accounts unchanged.

2. Consistency:

This property guarantees that a transaction transitions the database from one valid state to another. Before and after the transaction, 
the data must adhere to all defined constraints and business rules. For example, a transaction updating customer information 
(address, phone number) should ensure both values remain compatible (e.g., no phone number without an address).

3. Isolation:

This property ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction operates on its own private data copy, 
and changes are only visible to other transactions once committed.Imagine multiple users ordering tickets simultaneously. 
Isolation guarantees each user sees only their own chosen tickets, not a mix of different orders before commit.

4. Durability:

This property ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes become permanent and are not lost even in case of system failures. 
It guarantees data persistency across crashes or hardware malfunctions. For example, after successfully committing a purchase, the corresponding order 
and payment records should remain permanently stored, even if the system restarts later.

                Q8. Classify DDL, DML & DCL commands

* DDL (Data Definition Language) commands:

These commands define the structure of a database, including tables, views, indexes, and other objects. 
They are used to create, modify, or delete the database's schema.

** Common DDL commands:

CREATE: Creates database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.).
ALTER: Modifies existing database objects.
DROP: Deletes database objects.
RENAME: Renames database objects.
TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a table without deleting the table itself.

* DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands:

These commands manipulate data within existing database tables. They are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.

** Common DML commands:

SELECT: Retrieves data from a database.
INSERT: Adds new rows to a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
DELETE: Removes rows from a table.

* DCL (Data Control Language) commands:

These commands control access to database objects and operations. They are used to grant or revoke permissions to users and manage database security.

** Common DCL commands:

GRANT: Gives users specific permissions to access database objects.
REVOKE: Revokes previously granted permissions.
COMMIT: Makes changes made within a transaction permanent.
ROLLBACK: Undoes changes made within a transaction.
SAVEPOINT: Creates a temporary marker within a transaction to allow partial rollbacks.


            Q9. Explain Outer Join with suitable example.

Outer joins in database queries combine rows from two tables, even when there's no matching row in one of them. 
This includes all matching rows from both tables, plus rows from one table that don't have a corresponding match in the other, 
filled with NULL values for the missing columns.

Types of Outer Joins:

* Left Outer Join: Includes all rows from the left table (table mentioned first in the query) and matching rows from the right table.
 If a row in the left table doesn't have a match in the right table, NULL values are used for the right table's columns.

* Right Outer Join: Includes all rows from the right table (table mentioned second in the query) and matching rows from the left table. 
If a row in the right table doesn't have a match in the left table, NULL values are used for the left table's columns.

* Full Outer Join: Includes all rows from both tables, regardless of whether they have a match in the other table. 
NULL values are used for missing columns where there's no match.
