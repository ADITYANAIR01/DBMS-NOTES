                Candidate Key 

A Candidate Key is a minimal set of columns/attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a single row/tuple in a relation. Candidate Keys are identified during database design, considering the basic business rules of the database. Consider the following relation with regards to a business firm:
               
EmployeeNo (Key)
This seems to be a good candidate key as companies usually issue a unique number for each employee.)))(rationale)

AadharNo (Key)
This seems to be a good candidate key for a company based in India. However we have assumed that every
employee has an Aadhar number which may not be true. In addition for a multinational firm with employees
across the globe this will not work at all.(rationale)

Name, DateOfBirth (Key)
This might work for a small firm of 10 people as a combination of Name and Date of Birth is likely to be unique.(rationale)

// Thus the choice of candidate key depends upon the business context.
