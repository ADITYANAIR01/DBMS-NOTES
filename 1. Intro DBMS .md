                Database Management System 

DBMS (Database Management System) is an application software or collection of a set of
programmes that allows the user to store, modify and retrieve the information from a
database. It has complete access to the data through a query language to extract the
information. In the case of multiple users, it maintains the data consistency and also
allows the user to add and update the data.

                    Functions of DBMS
                    
1. Defining: Specification of the data types, structures and constraints for the data to be
stored in the database in involved in defining Of the database.

2. Constructing: The process of storing the data on some storage medium that is
controlled by the DBMS is known as constructing the database.

3. Manipulating: Functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data,
updating the database to reflect changes in the mini world and generating reports
from the data is included in manipulating the database.

4. Sharing: Allowing multiple users and programmes to access the database
concurrently is sharing a database.

5. Protecting: The system protection against hardware or software malfunction and
security protection against unauthorised or malicious access is included in protecting
the database.

6. Maintaining: In the lifecycle ofa large database, there will be a change in requirement
overtime, maintenance of the database system is allowed in DBMS.

                    Advantages & Disadvantages of DBMS


1. Data Independence: The DBMS provides an abstract view of the data that hide the
application programmes, should not ideally be, exposed to details of data
representation and storage.

2. Efficient Data Access: If the data is stored on external storage device then a DBMS
utilises a variety Of sophisticated techniques to Store and retrieve data efficiently.

3. Data Integrity and Security: DBMS can enforce integrity constraints if the data is
always accessed through the DBMS. Also, the access controls that govern what data is
visible to different classes of users can be enforced by DBMS.

4. Data Administration: Centralisation of administration of data becomes significant
when several users share the data.

5. Concurrent Access and Crash Recovery: Concurrent accesses to the data is shown in
DBMS in such a manner that users think of data as being accessed by only one user at
a time. The users are protected from the effects of system failures.

6. Reduced Application Development Time: Important tasks are handled by DBMS,
which makes it more robust than similar standalone applications.

                    (iii) Components of Database System

1. Input new data
2. Delete the data    
3. Modify the existing data
4. Reading data       

                    Database Languages 

1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

3. Data Control Language (DCL)

4. Transactional Control Language (TCL)  


             1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

Data Definition Language (DDL) is a standard for instructions that describes data and data
structures. The data schema can be defined and also changed accordingly with the help of
DDL. DDL allows the professionals to create tables, files, databases and data dictionary inside
databases.


            2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a language that offers a set of procedures to maintain
the fundamental data manipulation operations like change, read, search, store on the
information held in databases. It allows the users and the programmers to retrieve or select,
delete, insert, modify and update the information from the database.            

            3. Data Control Language (DCL)

Data Control Language (DCL) controls access to database and data using GRANT and
REVOKE statements. To a user, a privilege can either be granted or taken back (revoked).

            4. Transactional Control Language (TCL)  

Transaction Control Language (TCL) manages transactions in the database along with the
changes made by DML statements. It also allows statements to be grouped into logical
transactions. Commit, rollback and savepoint statements are used in TCL to carry out
transactions.
