                Data Integrity

Data integrity refers to maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency 
of data over its entire life-cycle. Database Systems ensure data integrity through 
constraints which are used to restrict data that can be entered or modified in the database. 
Database Systems offer three types of integrity constraints:

1. Entity Integrity
2. Domain Integrity
3. Referential Integrity

1. Entity Integrity:-
Each table must have a column or a set of columns through which we can uniquely identify a row.
These column(s) cannot have empty (null) values.PRIMARY KEY

2. Domain Integrity:-
All attributes in a table must have a defined domain i.e. a finite set of values 
which have to be used.When we assign a data type to a column we limit the values that it can contain. 
In addition we can also have value restriction as per business rules e.g. Gender must be M or F.

3. Referential Integrity :-

Every value of a column in a table must exist as a value of another column in a different (or the
same) table.FOREIGN KEY
